# smart-hostel-allocation
The Smart Hostel Room Allocation System is a web-based app to manage hostel rooms efficiently. Users can add rooms with details like room number, capacity, AC, and washroom availability, view all rooms, search based on requirements, and allocate the most suitable room automatically. The app uses localStorage for data persistence and features a responsive, user-friendly UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates DOM manipulation, filtering, and basic front-end development skills. To use, simply open index.html in a browser—no installation required. Future improvements could include edit/delete room functionality, student details storage, backend integration, and online deployment.
